# Deep-Convolutional-GAN
This project is divided into two parts:
1. Implementation of Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) designed to process images. Training of discriminator model to distinguish between origional and fake emojies (generated by Generator model) and training of generator model to generate emojis from samples of random noise. 
2. Researchers recomended methods were applied to "stablize" the training process of GANs and then train DCGAN again.
